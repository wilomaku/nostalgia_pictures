# Nostalgia

The combination of technological advancements, social trends, and storage solutions has led to the accumulation of a vast number of pictures in our devices. The increasing availability and accessibility of digital cameras and smartphones with high-quality camera features have made it easier for people to capture moments and experiences. Additionally, social media platforms have created a culture where sharing visual content is a norm. Many of us have hundreds or even thousands of photos buried in our devices that we rarely revisit. However, revisiting and appreciating them over time is a rewarding experience.

The goal of this project is bringing 'casually' some pictures of your never-visited pictures using some AI tools. From a story, the most fitting pictures are retrieved and shown in a cool video. Enjoy!

## Used tools

* Chat GPT (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to generate the story.
* LAVIS (https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS) to get captions from the pictures and perform the matching between captions and the story.
